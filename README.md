# Vikunja-Export

This is a tool to export relevant text from tasks in [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io) to Markdown files synced to Nextcloud.

This is very much tailored to my own use case, but it could be made more generic if there's interest.

My use case for this is taking useful notes I've previously added to tasks, and exporting them
to make them easily searchable using standard command line tools.

## Usage
Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv):
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Set Vikunja host and token as environment variables (or in a `.env` file):
```sh
export VJA_HOST=vikunja.example.com
export VJA_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

Run the script:
```sh
./main.py
```

## Output format
**Summary:**
A condensed summary of all tasks will be written to one file, in the format:
```
1âœ… : Inbox / test post, please ignore 2025-01-18
2âœ… : Software / Evaluate task management tools [ðŸ“–research] 2025-01-21
3   : Household / Replace HVAC air filter 2025-02-02
5   : Software / Make script to dump task text [ðŸ“–research] 2025-02-04
```

**Details:**
Any tasks with a description and/or comments will have their contents converted to separate
Markdown files, in the format:
```md
# Make script to dump task text

* Created: 2025-02-04
* Updated: 2025-02-10

# Description
This is mainly for the purpose of making my notes in Vikunja easily searchable
alongside my main Markdown notes.

Options to try out:
* CLI tool: [vja](https://github.com/cernst72/vja)
* API: [GET /tasks/all](https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs#tag/task/paths/~1tasks~1all/get)

## Jordan Cook 2025-02-06
Text fields are in HTML format. Looked through several options to convert back to Markdown.
This one looks promising: [html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text)
```
